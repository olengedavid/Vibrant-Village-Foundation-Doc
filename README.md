## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.12.1
- Erlang/OTP 24
- nodejs > 12 LTS
- PostgreSQL 12.7 
- Hex, Elixir's package manager


### Install
- Clone the project using `git clone url`
- For elixir and phoenix development environment use [the phoenix installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content) to ensure everything is setup as expected.

### Setup
**Start Server**

To run your phoenix server:

* Run `mix deps.get` to fetch and install dependecies.
* Run seeds, create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Install Node.js dependecies with `npm install` inside the `assests` directory.
* Start all your application endpoints with `mix phx.server`

### Usage
**Farmer registration**

Farmer can be registered through the following channels:
- Kobo.
- SMS.
- USSD.
- Web.

**SMS**
The farmer is asked a series of questions that they need to answer. All these data is temporarily stored in database table which is then transfered to the main farmers table upon completion.

**Technical steps**

| Step | Description|
| -----| -----------|
|1     |Welcome farmer and ask  for the farmer national id|
|2     |Ask for the names|
|3     |The year of birth|
|4     |Their phone number|
|



A farmer who initiates registration process is automatically at `step0` of registration. When they resume the process, question for `step1` will be asked. This means that the questions we ask the farmer is always  a step a head of the step we have in the database.

**KOBO**

[KoBoToolbox](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/new_form.html) is a free and open source software that is used for field data collection. The field officers use the kobo forms to collect farmer data which are later transmitted to Vibrant repo via a webhook.

The data can be collected while the devices are offline and be transmitted once the device get connected to the internet.

**koBo farmer registration form format**

- please take gps of home if possible .
- farmer gender.
- deviceId.
- group leader Id.
- nok name.

The form ensure data integrity rules are adhered to which reduces errors leading to better quality data.
